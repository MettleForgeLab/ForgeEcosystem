abstract: >
  The Forge Ecosystem defines a distributed constitutional framework
  for designing, deploying, and governing humane language systems.
  It establishes layered separation between training geometry,
  switching policy, deployment membrane constraints, and governance.
  This repository serves as the canonical source for Forge-based
  architectural and stability specifications.
