# Forge Ecosystem

**Status:** Canonical Source  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Scope:** Constitutional and governance architecture for Forge-based language systems  
**Attribution:** Mettle Forge Lab

## Purpose

The Forge Ecosystem defines the constitutional layer and governance architecture for Forge-based language systems.

It establishes:

- Non-overrideable structural constraints
- Deployment membrane requirements
- Drift and cascade containment mechanisms
- Stewardship and distributed governance posture
- Archival continuity and corruption prevention

This repository is not a product implementation.  
It is a reference specification.

## Architectural Position

**Dependency chain:**  
ForgeEcosystem (constitutional layer) → ConditionalBoundedness (control layer) → BoundedRuntime (deployment packaging).

ForgeEcosystem defines invariants and governance constraints.  
It does not contain switching mechanics or runtime packaging artifacts.

BoundedRuntime introduces no new constitutional invariants and does not override deployment membranes.
The Forge Ecosystem situates and preserves the switching architecture defined in the **Conditional Boundedness** repository.

Relationship across repositories:

- **Conditional Boundedness** — Switching-policy architecture and control-system framing
- **DataDiddler** — Deterministic meaning compilation for document sets
- **Forge Ecosystem** — Constitutional layer and ecological governance framework

The Forge does not replace switching logic.  
It defines the ecological and governance conditions under which such logic remains stable over time.
