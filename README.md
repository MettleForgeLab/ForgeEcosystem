# Forge Ecosystem

**Status:** Canonical Source  
**Version:** v1.0.0  
**Scope:** Constitutional and governance architecture for Forge-based language systems  
**Attribution:** Mettle Forge Lab

## Purpose

The Forge Ecosystem defines the constitutional layer and governance architecture for Forge-based language systems.

It establishes:

- Non-overrideable structural constraints
- Deployment membrane requirements
- Drift and cascade containment mechanisms
- Stewardship and distributed governance posture
- Archival continuity and corruption prevention

This repository is not a product implementation.  
It is a reference specification.

---

## Architectural Position

The Forge Ecosystem situates and preserves the switching architecture defined in the **Conditional Boundedness** repository.

Relationship across repositories:

- **Conditional Boundedness** — Switching-policy architecture and control-system framing
- **DataDiddler** — Deterministic meaning compilation for document sets
- **Forge Ecosystem** — Constitutional layer and ecological governance framework

The Forge does not replace switching logic.  
It defines the ecological and governance conditions under which such logic remains stable over time.
