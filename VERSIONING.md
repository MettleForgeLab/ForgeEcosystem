# Versioning Policy

The Forge Ecosystem uses semantic versioning for canonical documents.

Version format:

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

---

## Version Increments

### MAJOR (v2.0.0)

Incremented when:

- Constitutional layer constraints change
- Core invariants are modified
- Structural governance posture shifts
- Non-overrideable commitments are altered

Major revisions indicate breaking changes in architectural assumptions.

---

### MINOR (v1.1.0)

Incremented when:

- New canonical modules are added
- Governance mechanisms are expanded
- Clarifications materially affect interpretation
- Structural layers are reorganized without altering invariants

Minor revisions extend the architecture without weakening constraints.

---

### PATCH (v1.0.1)

Incremented when:

- Typos are corrected
- Formatting is improved
- Language is clarified without semantic shift
- References are updated

Patch revisions do not alter architectural meaning.

---

## Invariant Discipline

The following are considered constitutional invariants:

- Boundary-first design
- Non-inference
- Non-authority stance
- Stateless operation
- Deployment membrane constraints
- Use-case containment
- Distributed governance
- Stewardship over ownership

No invariant may be weakened without a MAJOR version increment.

---

## Relationship to Other Repositories

Each Forge repository maintains independent versioning.

ForgeEcosystem governs constitutional and ecological architecture.

ConditionalBoundedness governs switching-policy implementation.

DataDiddler governs deterministic meaning compilation.

Version changes in one repository do not automatically propagate to others.
